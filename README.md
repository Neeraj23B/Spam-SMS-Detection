# Spam-SMS-Detection
Develop an accurate and efficient system to classify SMS messages as spam or non-spam (ham) in real-time, effectively filtering unwanted and potentially harmful content. The solution should handle diverse spam tactics, minimize false positives and false negatives, and be scalable to handle a high volume of incoming messages.

## Overview
Spam SMS poses a significant threat in today's digital landscape. This repository focuses on implementing efficient classification techniques to detect spam SMS, aiming to reduce the influx of unwanted messages. The primary objective is to raise awareness about the importance of spam detection and illustrate effective methods for achieving it.

## Objective
Develop a robust and real-time SMS classification system capable of accurately identifying messages as spam or non-spam (ham). The system should efficiently filter out unwanted and potentially harmful content, handling various spam tactics while minimizing both false positives and false negatives. Moreover, the solution must be scalable to accommodate a high volume of incoming messages.

## Dataset
The repository includes a dataset comprising a collection of SMS messages, each accompanied by labels indicating whether they are classified as spam or non-spam (ham). Each message in the dataset is represented as a text string.

## Key Features
1. **Real-time Classification:** Implement a system that can classify SMS messages in real-time, ensuring prompt identification of spam.
2. **Diverse Spam Tactics Handling:** Address a range of spam tactics to create a comprehensive solution that adapts to evolving spam techniques.
3. **Minimization of False Positives and False Negatives:** Prioritize accuracy by minimizing both false positives (classifying non-spam as spam) and false negatives (classifying spam as non-spam).
4. **Scalability:** Design the system to be scalable, accommodating a high volume of incoming messages without compromising performance.

## Contents
1. **Code:** Contains the source code for the spam SMS detection system, developed in a language such as Python.
2. **Dataset:** Includes the dataset used for training and testing the system.
3. **Documentation:** Provides comprehensive documentation explaining the implementation details, algorithms used, and instructions for using and extending the system.
4. **Results:** Displays the performance metrics and results obtained during testing and evaluation.
